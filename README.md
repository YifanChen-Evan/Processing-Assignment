## 1.	Overview
         Many studies have shown that there is a positive correlation between experiencing positive emotions and the tendency to enjoy social interaction. Especially the use of personal pronouns has less correlation with neuroticism. Therefore, the creation of a movie requires an in-depth study of the lines that reflect the character's personalities. To enable users to experience the sophisticated design of movie lines, the application will provide users with 617 movies and regard characters and their lines as analysis objects to calculate the proportion of dialogue lines containing personal pronouns in the dialogue of the selected characters.

## 2.	Service offering and workflow
        When the user launches the application, the user interface will have a pop-up window, which provides 617 movies for the user to choose. After finishing the movie selection, then the user will see a drop-down window about all the characters of the selected movie. Just click “Ok” to view the lines related to the selected character. The left area of the interface is called "Dialogue Area", which is used to display all the lines related to the selected character. As some characters have more lines, in order to display the lines completely, the ControlP5 library is imported here to create a text area. The area on the right side of the interface shows the function introduction of the application and the percentage result of dialogue lines containing personal pronouns in the lines.

## 3.	Limitations
        Due to the limitations of time and skills, it does not implement a user interface that can filter by movie genre, movie year, or movie ranking.
